# DotA :: Prolog mode

This is something I've been working on, on-and-off, for a couple of years. Prolog has always been interesting to me due to it's declarative nature, which most of us with our imperative programming jobs don't get exposed to. It's a nice departure from the ordinary, simple shenanigans of working with C/C++.

# Starting Prolog

That's easy; make sure you have SWI-Prolog installed.

From your terminal, start the interpreter with either `pl` or `swipl`.

Load the DotA database:

    ?- [dota].
    %  dota_items compiled 0.00 sec, 38,088 bytes
    % dota compiled 0.00 sec, 41,344 bytes
    true.

# What items go into a build?

That's easy!

    ?- quick_buy(necronomicon3, X).
    X = [staffOfWizardry, beltOfStrength, recipe(necronomicon1), recipe(necronomicon2), recipe(necronomicon3)].
