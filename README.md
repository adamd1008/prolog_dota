# DotA :: Prolog mode

This is something I've been working on, on-and-off, over the past couple of years. Prolog has always been interesting to me due to it's declarative nature, which most of us with our imperative programming jobs don't get exposed to. It's a nice departure from the ordinary, (relatively) simple shenanigans of working with C/C++.

# Starting Prolog

That's easy; make sure you have SWI-Prolog installed.

From your terminal, start the interpreter with either `pl` or `swipl`.

Load the DotA database:

    ?- [dota].
    %  dota_items compiled 0.00 sec, 38,088 bytes
    % dota compiled 0.00 sec, 41,344 bytes
    true.

# What items go into a build?

That's easy!

    ?- quick_buy(necronomicon3, X).
    X = [staffOfWizardry, beltOfStrength, recipe(necronomicon1), recipe(necronomicon2), recipe(necronomicon3)].
